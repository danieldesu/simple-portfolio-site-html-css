DanielDesu.com code when published on June 5th 2022. Live site will be updated, GitHub repository probably won't.
Currently not using any JavaScript on the site but still used my Webpack & Babel template for the project, to add JS easily later on if I want to.

Build JavaScript with "npm run build".
Webpack server with "npm run dev", running on port 3000.
